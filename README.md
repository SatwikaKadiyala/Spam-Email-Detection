  • Developed a Machine Learning(ML) model to detect spam emails with high accuracy using Python and TensorFlow.
  • Analyzed and preprocessed a dataset of over 5000+ emails, extracting key features such as keyword frequency, sender
    behavior, and metadata patterns.
  • Deployed the model on AWS using Lambda for serverless execution, ensuring scalability and efficiency.
